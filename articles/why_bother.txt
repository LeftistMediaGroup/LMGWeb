Why Bother Overthrowing Capitalism Anyway?

Capitalism is the driving force between the death and destruction caused in the modern day.

Capitalism forces the idea of infinite consumption in a finite world, these ideas are incompatible and will only lead to our destruction. 

Capitalism forces extreme individuality, to the point where all basic necessities are held back from everyone, like a gun to the head of every person, where the only possibility of  survival is to either be born into generational wealth or sell your labour value. 

Anarchism stresses community, and through community is our only salvation. 

To be anti-capitalist is to promote community at all possible times. To defend and support each other at all costs.

Without community, we will not survive climate change or a capitalist induced nuclear holocaust.

So why bother? Because everything you love depends on it.
